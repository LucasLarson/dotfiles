# QLColorCode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anthonygelibert/QLColorCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anthonygelibert/QLColorCode)

**Original project:** <http://code.google.com/p/qlcolorcode/>

This is a Quick Look plug-in that renders source code with syntax highlighting,
using the [Highlight library](http://www.andre-simon.de).

To install Highlight, [download the library manually](http://www.andre-simon.de/zip/download.php), or use Homebrew `brew install highlight`

To install the plug-in, just drag it to `~/Library/QuickLook`.
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.

Alternative, if you use [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask),
install with `brew cask install qlcolorcode`.

## Settings

If you want to configure `QLColorCode`, there are several `defaults` commands that could be useful:

Setting the text encoding (default is `UTF-8`). Two settings are required. The first sets Highlight's encoding, the second sets Webkit's:

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode textEncoding UTF-16
    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode webkitTextEncoding UTF-16

Setting the font (default is `Menlo`):

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode font Monaco

Setting the font size (default is `10`):

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode fontSizePoints 9

Setting the color style (default is `edit-xcode`, see [all available themes](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/theme-samples.php)):

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode hlTheme ide-xcode

Setting the thumbnail color style (deactivated by default):

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode hlThumbTheme ide-xcode

Setting the maximum size (in bytes, deactivated by default) for previewed files:

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode maxFileSize 1000000

Setting any extra command-line flags for Highlight (see below):

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode extraHLFlags '-l -W'

Here are some useful 'highlight' command-line flags (from the man page):

       -F, --reformat=<style>
              reformat output in given style.   <style>=[ansi,  gnu,  kr,
              java, linux]

       -J, --line-length=<num>
              line length before wrapping (see -W, -V)

       -j, --line-number-length=<num>
              line number length incl. left padding

       -l, --line-numbers
              print line numbers in output file

       -t  --replace-tabs=<num>
              replace tabs by num spaces

       -V, --wrap-simple
              wrap long lines without indenting function  parameters  and
              statements

       -W, --wrap
              wrap long lines

       -z, --zeroes
              fill leading space of line numbers with zeroes

       --kw-case=<upper|lower|capitalize>
              control case of case insensitive keywords

**Warning:** my fork uses an external `Highlight`. It will attempt to find `highlight` on your `PATH` (so it should work out of the box for Homebrew and MacPorts), but if it can't find it, it'll use `/opt/local/bin/highlight` (MacPorts default). This can be changed:

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode pathHL /path/to/your/highlight

It is also possible to have the HTML preview converted to RTF. Using RTF
allows the contents of the file to be displayed instead of an icon -- similar
to QLStephen.

    defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode rtfRender true

## Additional information

### Additional features

#### Decompile

QLColorCode decompiles some formats:

- **Compiled AppleScript**. It requires `osadecompile` installed at `/usr/bin/osadecompile`.
- **Binary PLIST**. It requires `plutil` installed at `/usr/bin/plutil`.

### Highlight

#### Plug-ins

QLColorCode enables some Highlight plug-ins :

- In all languages:  `outhtml_codefold` and `reduce_filesize`.
- Java (sources and classes): `java_library`.
- C/C++: `cpp_syslog`, `cpp_ref_cplusplus_com` and `cpp_ref_local_includes`.
- Perl: `perl_ref_perl_org`.
- Python: `python_ref_python_org`.
- Shell: `bash_functions`.
- Scala: `scala_ref_scala_lang_org`.

#### Handled languages

Highlight can handle lots and lots of languages, but this plug-in will only be
invoked for file types that the OS knows are type "source-code". Since the OS
only knows about a limited number of languages, I've added Universal Type
Identifier (UTI) declarations for several "interesting" languages. If I've
missed your favorite language, take a look at the Info.plist file inside the
plug-in bundle and look for the UTImportedTypeDeclarations section. I
haven't added all the languages that Highlight can handle because it's rumored
that having two conflicting UTI declarations for the same file extension can
cause problems. Note that if you do edit the Info.plist file you need to
nudge the system to tell it something has changed. Moving the plug-in to the
desktop then back to its installed location should do the trick.

As an aside, by changing colorize.sh you can use this plug-in to render any file
type that you can convert to HTML. Have fun, and let me know if you do anything
cool!

##### Adding Language Types

If QLColorCode doesn't display PHP and JavaScript code properly, their types may
need to be added to Info.plist. Finding the right type string to use is the
tricky part. Getting the type strings and getting Info.plist edits to take effect
is easy by following the steps below, which explain how to add support for PHP:

1. In Terminal.app (or any shell prompt), enter the command:

  ``` bash
  mdls -name kMDItemContentType /full/path/to/file.php
  ```

  Use the path to any PHP file. The response will be:

  ``` txt
  kMDItemContentType = "public.php-script"
  ```

  The string `public.php-script` is the type string needed in a later step.

2. Again at a shell prompt, enter the command:

  ``` bash
  open ~/Library/QuickLook/QLColorCode.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist
  ```

  This will open Info.plist in Xcode.app.

3. In Xcode.app's edit window for Info.plist, go to:

  Document types > Item 0 > Document Content Type UTIs

  (If the editor is showing raw keys, that's:
  CFBundleDocumentTypes > Item 0 > LSItemContentTypes)

4. Add an item for `public.php-script`, the type string found in the first step.
5. Save the updated Info.plist file.
6. Try it in Finder. (It's usually unnecessary to move/return the QLColorCode extension, restart QuickLook, or restart the Finder, but it wouldn't be surprising that some users might need to do so.)

The Info.plist included with this version of QLColorCode already contains types
for PHP and JavaScript code, but these steps show how easy it is to add other
types. (Maybe somebody will develop a Preference Pane for QLColorCode to make
this even easier.)
