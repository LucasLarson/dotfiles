## [2.0.1] — 2009-09-18

      `defaults write org.n8gray.qlcolorcode qlcc_debug 1`

      `defaults delete org.n8gray.qlcolorcode qlcc_debug`

### Changed

### Fixed

## [2.0.0] — 2009-09-17

### Added

- A note about conflict with Xcode 3.2's source code QL plugin. If you're having problems with QLCC on Snow Leopard please read it!
- Support for `Scala`, `Groovy`, `Interactive Data Language`, and `Coldfusion`.
- Build for `x86_64` in addition to `i386` and `ppc`.

### Changed

- Upgrade `highlight` from `2.6.6` to `2.12` -- This was long overdue.  It's nice not to have to patch highlight anymore!

### Removed

- Customized `.css` language definition -- it was fixed upstream.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused `QLCC` to fail on files whose names contained '`%`'.

## [1.1] — 2009-01-10

### Added

- Enabled "safe" plain-text handling.  In other words, files like foo.txt will be supported, but not files without extensions.  The only way to handle extensionless files is to handle -everything-.  This can be done, but it requires a more defensive style of operation.
- Support for `textEncoding` option to set encoding for highlight portion of renderer, with default `UTF-8`.
- Support for `webkitTextEncoding` option to set encoding for webkit portion of renderer, with default `UTF-8`.
- Support for `.cs`, `.el`, `.jnlp` (xml), `.e` (eiffel), and `.vb`.

### Fixed

- Fixed support for `Verilog` files.

## [1.0] — 2008-01-07

### Added

- `Actionscript`, `Lisp`, `IDL`, `Verilog`, `VHDL`, `XHTML`  (any others I forgot?).
- `.cls` and `.sty` as LaTeX extensions.
- `maxFileSize` option to keep us from hanging on huge files.

### Fixed

- Hopefully fixed the crasher bug by keeping us single-threaded.

## [0.4] — 2008-01-07

### Added

- Added `Tcl`, `Lua`, and `JSP` support.

### Changed

- Can now configure appearance with `defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode ...` commands.

### Fixed

- Improved `OCaml`, `C/C++` and `Obj-C` modes.

## [0.3] — 2007-12-15

### Added

- Added `.command` as an alternate extension for shell scripts.
- Added `.mll` and `.mly` extensions for `OCaml`.
- Include customized `.css` and `.c` language definition files.
- Created a `slateGreen` theme that matches my editor colors.

### Changed

- If highlight fails to colorize a file render it as plain text.

### Fixed

- Ensure highlight is compiled as a Universal Binary.

## [0.2] — 2007-12-14

### Added

- Added thumbnailing support.
- Added UTIs for `.css`, `.sql`, `.erl`, and `.sml`.

### Changed

- Switched from Pygments to Highlight.  This should increase speed-and-language coverage.
- Changed `.tex` `UTI` to agree with TeXShop's.
- (Try to) let the system pick a different plugin if ours fails.
