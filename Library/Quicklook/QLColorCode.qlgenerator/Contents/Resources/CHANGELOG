2.0.1:
    * Corrected build of Highlight to run on Leopard.

      in the console instead of the preview.
    * Added qlcc_debug option.  To enable, use:
            defaults write org.n8gray.qlcolorcode qlcc_debug 1

2.0:
    * Added a note about conflict with Xcode 3.2's source code QL plugin.  If
      you're having problems with QLCC on Snow Leopard please read it!
    * Fixed a bug that caused QLCC to fail on files whose names contained '%'.
    * Added support for Scala, Groovy, Interactive Data Language, and Coldfusion
    * Upgrade highlight from 2.6.6 to 2.12 -- This was long overdue.  It's nice
      not to have to patch highlight anymore!
    * Removed customized .css language definition -- it was fixed upstream.
    * Build for x86_64 in addition to i386 and ppc

1.1:
    * Enabled "safe" plain-text handling.  In other words, files like foo.txt
      will be supported, but not files without extensions.  The only way to
      handle extensionless files is to handle *everything*.  This can be done,
      but it requires a more defensive style of operation.
    * Added support for "textEncoding" option to set encoding for highlight
      portion of renderer, with default UTF-8.
    * Added support for "webkitTextEncoding" option to set encoding for webkit
      portion of renderer, with default UTF-8.
    * Added support for .cs, .el, .jnlp (xml), .e (eiffel), and .vb
    * Fixed support for verilog files

1.0:
    * Hopefully fixed the crasher bug by keeping us single-threaded
    * Added Actionscript, Lisp, IDL, Verilog, VHDL, XHTML  (any others I forgot?)
    * Added .cls and .sty as LaTeX extensions
    * Added maxFileSize option to keep us from hanging on huge files.

0.4:
    * Added Tcl, Lua, and JSP support
    * Can now configure appearance with "defaults write org.n8gray.QLColorCode ..." commands
    * Improved OCaml, C/C++ and Obj-C modes.

0.3:
    * Ensure highlight is compiled as a universal binary
    * If highlight fails to colorize a file render it as plain text
    * Added .command as an alternate extension for shell scripts
    * Added .mll and .mly extensions for OCaml
    * Include customized .css and .c language definition files
    * Created a slateGreen theme that matches my editor colors.  :-)

0.2:
    * Switched from Pygments to Highlight.  This should increase speed *and* language coverage.
    * Added thumbnailing support
    * Changed .tex UTI to agree with TeXShop's.
    * (Try to) let the system pick a different plugin if ours fails
    * Added UTIs for .css, .sql, .erl, and .sml
