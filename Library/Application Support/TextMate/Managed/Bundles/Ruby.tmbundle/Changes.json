It would also fail for gems that have a slash/dash in their name, for example ‘rack/protection’ is one gem named ‘rack-protection’ (and not a file named ‘protection’ in the ‘rack’ gem)."},{"commit":"5711fb84b432742ca637ed122cc23433e92bb623","date":"2019-08-03T10:57:10+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Rework “Open Require” (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘D</kbd>) to work inside gems and for require_relative","body":"The command previously used ruby 1.8 and therefore would only search for includes and gems using ruby 1.8’s load path.\n\nFurthermore, it would not support `require_relative` nor would it handle a `require` inside of a gem (since that `require` would be relative to the gem’s load path).\n\nThe previous command would, when used on a line without a `require` or `load` statement, search the entire file and present a menu. I have not replicated this behavior, as it’s not something I have ever used myself. I think a better behavior would be to open an input dialog, like the C bundle’s Quick Open.\n\nLastly, the load path used is that of the ruby found via PATH, ideally it should use TM_RUBY (when set)."},{"commit":"556da233f17e46813d3ab182303dcbc6b570d1af","date":"2019-07-15T21:46:06+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Allow folding indented code blocks below ‘when’ statements","body":"Since when statements can have their code “inline”, e.g. “when match: do_something” we match lines with ‘when’ keywords either not containing any ‘then’ or colon (‘:’), or where ‘then’ or colon are the last things on the line (except for a trailing line comment)."},{"commit":"05698e99314d8653e2e9d8f198d3c83e387ee1eb","date":"2019-07-15T15:27:19+02:00","author":"Markus Reiter","summary":"Add `Podfile` file type."},{"commit":"2a5ec1912257cdbb67f70c633d6d66f7832f716b","date":"2019-07-15T16:53:37+02:00","author":"Markus Reiter","summary":"Add `__dir__` variable."},{"commit":"5c7d34304be7ed78b40a721aa713231cb18429b7","date":"2019-07-02T11:44:38+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Fix: Text after __END__ marker was still parsed as ruby code","body":"This was broken by 6628e6c1872eed32c2e8ec5930649ff115fdb998 which made `variable.other.constant.ruby` match __END__ as well, and as it had a higher priority than our __END__ marker match, it would win."},{"commit":"70c077c95cbcef35dc685809d8fe0931286d3a53","date":"2019-07-02T11:37:32+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Update how we find the `ri` executable (Documentation for Word)","body":"You can set `TM_RUBY_RI` if you need to use a specific version."},{"commit":"94f2fcb7620b2884038f5876960f3cbcb43844d1","date":"2019-04-20T00:06:35+02:00","author":"Stefan Daschek","summary":"Fix `Executable.find` to work with Ruby 1.8","body":"`Executable.find` is used by commands running with Ruby 1.8 (like for example “Reformat document”), so it has to be compatible with Ruby 1.8.\n\nA nice side-effect of this change is that the tests in `test_executable.rb` can now be run from within TextMate without setting a specific project directory. The Gemfile is no longer necessary, too.\n\nFixes #128"},{"commit":"300b9961332c6dc8e282bd8c3192c2ea528f95a6","date":"2019-02-20T04:04:07-06:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Allow snippet use in Javascript (Rails)"},{"commit":"86d697f7b48bfa178bace5382ca685d804a5e5bc","date":"2019-02-05T09:22:40+01:00","author":"Kevin Sjöberg","summary":"Add frozen string literal magic comment snippet"},{"commit":"d5aa369c43ef12355e81d62b93f9c2eea46bd91c","date":"2018-07-28T19:23:42+02:00","author":"Stefan Daschek","summary":"If Gemfile present, always assume `bundle exec …`","body":"While trying to be smart about whether the requested executable is actually part of the Gemfile was a nice idea, in practice it didn’t work out:\n\nGems may include executables with names different than the name of the gem itself. Most prominent example: the `rspec` executable is provided by the gem `rspec-core` (for the record: this was causing https://github.com/rspec/rspec.tmbundle/issues/111).\n\nSo from now an let’s just assume that if a project has a Gemfile, any executable should be run via `bundle exec …`. If needed, this behaviour can still be changed on a per-project basis by providing a custom binstub or setting `TM_$EXECUTABLE` appropriately.\n\nFixes #120."},{"commit":"73ff0be58a4c0b800662978ee034fe0376cf8b35","date":"2018-07-28T18:52:53+02:00","author":"Stefan Daschek","summary":"Add Gemfile for running tests","body":"Explicitly requiring `bundler/setup` makes sure that the tests can still be run by simply pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘R</kbd>"},{"commit":"74713556df10fbc7b1f9e99013ab1e34cd836f56","date":"2016-08-21T01:28:56+09:00","author":"Kenichi Kamiya","summary":"Match `public_class_method` as keyword.other.special-method"},{"commit":"daa9d848d94ef559d62ecc8a6acc893339ab6dc8","date":"2017-08-05T15:31:12-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Allow `0` to get constant.numeric.integer scope","body":"The rubyspec isn&#39;t actually clear if this is a octal or not, but the ISO spec says it is an integer."},{"commit":"905e49fadc57808f24dce47f4adc6bed3aee1f5e","date":"2017-08-05T14:35:42-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Match paired parentheses and braces in arguments","body":"Fixes #113 and Microsoft/vscode#31738."}],"name":"Ruby"}
