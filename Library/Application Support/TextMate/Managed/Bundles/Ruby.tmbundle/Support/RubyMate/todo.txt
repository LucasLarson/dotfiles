Syntax Errors
=============
Syntax errors will be written to stderr. We should catch these and turn them into clickable links.


Exit Status
===========
The exit code from the process we span is not shown. This is a limitation of popen3, but we could role a replacement for that.


Errors From Included Files
==========================
These could be shown differently to make them distinguishable.
