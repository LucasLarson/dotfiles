Installation
============

To install the sitemap app, follow these steps:

    * Add ``'django.contrib.sitemaps'`` to your :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`
      setting.

    * Make sure ``'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader'``
      is in your :setting:`TEMPLATE_LOADERS` setting. It's in there by default,
      so you'll only need to change this if you've changed that setting.

    * Make sure you've installed the
      :mod:`sites framework <django.contrib.sites>`.

(Note: The sitemap application doesn't install any database tables. The only
reason it needs to go into :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` is so that the
:func:`~django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader` template
loader can find the default templates.)
