[1] [2]\n\nThis causes TextMate’s Bundle Support library (which uses the `%-&lt;&gt;`\ntrim mode specifier [3]) to print a warning when run via Ruby 2.6.\n\nThe workaround proposed here is to use the `ruby20` shim, which\npoints to system Ruby 2.3 as of macOS 10.14. That’s how other\nTextMate bundles do it if they depend on some post-1.8 feature\n(such as `json`) but still need some legacy behavior. [4]\n\nFuture macOS versions may re-introduce this issue if they come with\nRuby 2.6 or later. That will also affect other TextMate bundles. [4]\nIn that case, we’re going to need alternative fixes, for example\nvendoring a pure-Ruby JSON library [5] or even vendoring Ruby itself\n(like TextMate does with Ruby 1.8 today).\n\n[1] https://redmine.ruby-lang.org/attachments/7457\n\n[2] https://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/15294\n\n[3] https://github.com/textmate/bundle-support.tmbundle/blob/39042ef25cc5603054eee11f27c2ea91d54a6cdf/Support/shared/lib/tm/htmloutput.rb#L91\n\n[4] https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atextmate+ruby20&amp;type=Code\n\n[5] https://github.com/textmate/sql.tmbundle/blob/6d4edbc113d3272f7c097d6b1504624289ee2bc5/Support/lib/json.rb"},{"commit":"f28b1e952a5c11dde4ecc14f71d4a981b543d7b7","date":"2019-05-02T09:09:02-04:00","author":"Carol (Nichols || Goulding)","summary":"Suppress warnings about unused patches (#42)","body":"Suppress warnings about unused patches"},{"commit":"98786e900529e74cdfa4dec08b48be8c28f170c7","date":"2019-04-02T13:25:52-04:00","author":"Rob Tsuk","summary":"Suppress warnings about unused patches","body":"The Fuchsia build environment produces Cargo.toml\nfiles with lots of patch statements that aren’t used\nby every crate.
