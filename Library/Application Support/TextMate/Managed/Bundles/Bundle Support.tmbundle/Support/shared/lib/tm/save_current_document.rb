    # Calling TextMate.save_current_document ensures that one of the following hold true:
    #  1. If TM_FILEPATH is writeable, then the current document is saved.
    #     In this case, TM_FILEPATH, TM_FILENAME, TM_DISPLAYNAME are left as is.
    #  2. If TM_FILEPATH is not writeable, then the contents of the current
    #     document will be saved in a temporary file.
    #     In this case:
    #       TM_FILEPATH, TM_FILENAME reflect the temporary file.
    #       TM_ORIG_FILEPATH and TM_ORIG_FILENAME will reflect the original unwriteable file.
    #       TM_DISPLAYNAME will be annotated by (M) to show that the file has not been saved.
    #  3. If TM_FILEPATH is unset, the current document has never been saved.  
    #     The current document's content will be saved in a temporary file.
    #     In this case: 
    #       TM_FILEPATH, TM_FILENAME reflect the temporary file.
    #       TM_FILE_IS_UNTITLED will be set to “true”
    #       TM_DISPLAYNAME will be set to “untitled”
    #  There is a funny case where if a new file file has been created with `mate` but has
    #  not yet been saved.  In this case TM_FILEPATH is set, but no file exists at that
    #  path.  If the directory is writeable, we touch the file and fall through to the 
    #  above cases.  If the directory is unwritable, we fall through without action.
    #
    # TextMate.save_current_document also accepts an optional `temp_ext` argument.  If
    # a temporary file is used it will have `temp_ext` as it's extension.
    #
    # Note that this method calls STDIN.read.  If you want to access the contents of the
    # current document after you've called this method, do File.read(ENV['TM_FILEPATH']).
