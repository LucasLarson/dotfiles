# == Description
#
# RubyWrap is a word wrapper utility designed for ruby scripts.  It should,
# however work for any programming language which uses an initial prefix for
# comments (see --prefix).  RubyWrap correctly handles indented comments,
# indented text within comments, header comments, and many forms of lists.  It
# will also pass through code without change and detabify.
#
# See Example.
#
# == Example
#
# The following text will all wrap correctly.
#
#  # This a header...
#  # ... it will not absorb this line.
#  #
#  #     This block of text will be left alone by default as it represents 
#  #     a verbatim block of RDoc text.  If the -n option is given then
#  #     RDoc-Style is off then it will be correctly wrapped, maintaining it's
#  #     indentation level.  In any case it will not abosrb...
#  #  ... this line because this line has a different indentation level.
#  #
#       # This comment will retain it's indentation and correctly wrap when
#       # it goes over over the page width.
#
#  # label  This is a list.  It contains a label and some text.  If the text
#  #        is indented past the label and the final space lines up then it
#  #        is considered to be a single block and properly wrapped.  Note
#  #        that this requires at least two lines to get right.
#
#  # * This is an rdoc list element.  It properly wraps even as a single line
#  #   and does not require a second line to wrap correctly.
#
#  # * Here are two rdoc list elements.  Even though they are adjacent...
#  # * ... they will not wrap.
#
#
# == Headers
#
# RubyWrap uses a very simple algorithm for identifying headers: it looks for
# short lines.  Any line below a certain threshold is not-wrapped. By default
# this threshold is 50, it can be changed with -s.
#
# == Non Rdoc Style
#
# When RDoc style is turned off (-n) RubyWrap identifies list items by looking
# for a label and then a second line indented past the label.  This means that
# single line list items do not wrap, the second line is required.
#
# Blocks of text indented after the # are wrapped maintaining their
# indentation level.
#
# == RDoc Style (Default)
#
# In RDOc style RubyWrap looks for lines that appear to be RDoc list items.
# These lines are then properly wrapped with later lines indented properly and
# closely set list items do not wrap together.
#
# Text indented after the # is considered to be verbatim and left alone.
#
# RDoc tries to find a natural margin for comments.  RubyWrap currently does
# not do this.  If you use more than a single space after your # then you
# should redefine the prefix with -p.
#
# == Comment Prefix
#
# The comment prefix can be changed with -p.  By default the comment prefix is
# "# ".  Note the trailing space.  You will generally want a trailing space
# for any prefix.  If you prefer to indent your comments more than a single
# space past the # then change the prefix appropriately.
#
# == Limitations
#
# * Doesn't handle multilevel RDoc lists correctly.  This is a balance between
#   recognizing verbatim blocks and list items.  A nice solution would be to
#   treat it is a list item if it appeared to be a part of a list but that
#   would require context beyond the current block.
# * Doesn't find the natural margin like RDoc does.  This can easily be
#   overcome by -p but it would be a nice feature.  Probably not too hard.
#
# == Using with other languages
#
# With appropriate use of -r and -p RubyWrap should work for any language that
# distinguishes comments by some prefix.  Languages that use "# " should work
# well out of the box.

Options:
  --prefix, -p <prefix>       Use <prefix> as the comment prefix.
  --shortthreshold -s <n>     Lines of length <= n are single line blocks.
  --cols, -c <n>              How many columns to wrap to (default: 78)
  --tabsize, -t <n>           How many spaces a tab is (default: 2)
  --no-rdoc-style, -n         Do not use RDoc conventions.
  --retabify, -r              Retabify output.
  --help, -h                  Display this help.
  --doc, -d                   Display full documentation.

# _post_indent_::       how many spaecs to put after $prefix and before text
