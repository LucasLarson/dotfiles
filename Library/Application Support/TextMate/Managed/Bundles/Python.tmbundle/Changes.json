This is pretty handy for long lists, constructor use, etc. The current default start/stop markers only fold on triple-quoted docstrings. I kept those patterns, but added to each one so they&#39;ll now also match on {}, (), and []. Supports lines with comments to the right of them, and closing markers followed by commas in case it&#39;s being declared as part of a longer list or tuple."},{"commit":"2e6fe8bcd8251454ff7507692fdf6342316d27ef","date":"2020-05-06T14:32:51+02:00","author":"Freek Dijkstra","summary":"Import escape from html instead of cgi","body":"cgi.escape was deprecated in Python 3.2 and removed from Python 3.8. Keep using cgi for anything below 3.0 of Python."}],"name":"Python"}
