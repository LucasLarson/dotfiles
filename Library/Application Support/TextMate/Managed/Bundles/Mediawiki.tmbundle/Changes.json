This causes it to fail validation\nwhen e.g. converting from the tmLanguage file to a .sublime-syntax file.\n\nI think removing it should be harmless given it is referencing something\nnon-existent anyway."},{"commit":"bdd6eeb5ee28c6fcc70cb76c7951c7da8f54e642","date":"2016-09-20T23:43:29-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Update include scopes","body":"`text.html` â†’ `text.html.basic`\n\nAnd the math parts of TeX have been moved from a grammar into a repository item in the main grammar."}],"name":"Mediawiki"}
