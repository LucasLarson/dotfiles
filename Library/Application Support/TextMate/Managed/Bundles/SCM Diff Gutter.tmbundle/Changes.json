This leads to following error:\n\n    Update Gutter:38:in `block in &lt;main&gt;&#39;: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 (ArgumentError)\n    \tfrom Update Gutter:35:in `open&#39;\n    \tfrom Update Gutter:35:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;\n\nThis is especially annoying because this error pops up every time the document is saved (because the “Update Gutter” command runs on every save).\n\nSetting `ascii-8bit` encoding directly on the io object works around the issue as we only care about the beginning part of the line not the actual contents. Fixes #7."}],"name":"SCM Diff Gutter"}
