# LaTeX Watch,
#  - by Robin Houston, 2007, 2008.
#  - by Ren√© Schwaiger, 2014, 2015.

# Usage: latex_watch.pl [ options ] file.tex
#
# Options:
#  --debug, -d             Pop up dialog boxes containing debugging info
#  --debug-to-console      Print debugging messages to stdout
#  --textmate-pid <pid>    Exit if the process <pid> disappears
#  --progressbar-pid <pid> Kill <pid> after the document has been compiled for
#                          the 1st time
#
# Example usage using `fish` (http://fishshell.com):
#
#   set tm_pid (pgrep TextMate); and LaTeX.tmbundle/Support/bin/latex_watch.pl \
#       -d --textmate-pid=$tm_pid path/to/texfile.tex

BUGS?
   - Spews too much information to the console

LIMITATIONS:
   - Cannot specify different modes per file.
   - Only works with latex, xelatex and lualatex not ConTeXt, etc.

FUTURE:
   - Support DVI route without GV, warning where appropriate.
     [If GV not installed, fall back to something else.]
   - Support xetex.
   - If TM_LATEX_VIEWER unset, sniff available viewers and pick one.
     (If it's set to "Preview", warn that Preview sucks and look for another.)
   - Nicer error output would be a really nice feature

Changes
1.1:
   - Include $! in error message if ps_viewer fails to start
   - run etex in batchmode
   - deal sensibly with compilation errors (don't just quit, offer to show log)
   - use 'gv -scale 1' (x 1.414) instead of '-scale 2' (x 2)

1.2:
   - Add Fink path (/sw/bin) to $PATH
   - Improved error handling in the command
   - don't assume this script is executable
   - work if perl is in PATH, even if it's not in /usr/bin

1.3:
   - Send errors to /dev/console rather than /tmp/out. (Thanks, Allan!)
   - Add default MacTeX location to PATH
   - support GV 3.6.[0-1], which has a different command-line syntax (!)
      (this is fixed in 3.6.2, but some users have 3.6.[01])
   - Move changelog to end of file
   - Handle preamble errors better
   - Take file path and switches on the command-line

1.4:
   - Set $/ in cocoa_dialog, or it won't work when called from reload().

1.5:
   - Add --debug-to-console option
   - Add --textmate-pid option
   - Throw an error if command-line options can't be parsed
   - Detect changes in files referenced by preamble
   - Detect changes in files referenced by body
   - Set $DISPLAY to ":0" if it isn't already set

2.0:
   - Add PDF support, using TeXShop as the viewer
   - Add TeXniscope support

2.1:
   - Add PDFView support: in fact, add rudimentary support for arbitrary
     viewer applications.
   - Don't attempt to close doc on cleanup, if we know it's already been closed.
   - Add -s switch to check_open, and pass it when not debugging.
   - Remove TM_LATEX_WATCH_VIEWER. Always use TM_LATEX_VIEWER instead.
   - Use TM_LATEX_PROGRAM to decide how to behave, instead of
     TM_LATEX_WATCH_MODE.

2.2:
   - Change button names on error dialog to 'Show Log' and 'Don't Show'.
   - Progress bar on initial compilation.
   - Add .pdf and .pdfsync to the list of files to clean up.
   - Don't skip dotfiles, so e.g. display will update if citation details
     change.
   - If in PDF mode, use pdfetex even for the format generation. This allows
     the graphics package (and other packages, potentially) to assume the
     correct mode.
   - Help file.
   - Support for the Skim previewer.
   - pdfsync synchronisation now works.
   - Include a copy of pdfsync in the bundle, because the LaTeX bundle
     has its own pdfsync, so users might be confused if it works with ‚åòR
     but not with Watch. For the same reason, I have included the same
     version that the LaTeX bundle uses, rather than the latest version,
     since pdfsync 1.0 seems to conflict with more packages (e.g. diagrams).

2.3:
   - Rename the PDF file after generation, to prevent viewers from attempting
     to reload it when it's partially generated.
   - As a side-effect of the above, two-way syncing now works with Skim!
   - Improve change detection logic, so that changes made during compilation
     are not ignored.
   - Fix recently-introduced bug that caused incorrect watcher_pid to be
     recorded.

2.4:
   - Warn if PostScript mode is used with a non-default previewer.
   - Expand the help file a little.
   - With TeXShop, use open_for_externaleditor on the .tex file, to work
     around an encoding-related bug in TeXShop.
   - Add a refresh command for Skim, which works in Skim 0.5 and later.
     This is just as well, since the automatic file-change checking is broken
     in Skim 0.5!

2.5:
   - Delete .watcher_pid file on exit. (I think this was broken by 2.3.)
   - Fix bug introduced in 2.4 that broke TeXShop updating.
   - Use a sanitised name for the .foo.* files, because format names containing
     spaces don't seem to work (so we would fail for filenames with spaces in).
   - Change into the working directory, rather than using the full path, to
     avoid problems caused by special characters in the name of some ancestor
     directory.
   - Quote Applescript strings, so that filenames containing special characters
     (backslash and double quote) will not cause Applescript errors. (They do
     still cause problems with PDFSync in Skim: see
     http://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/bugs/72/)
   - Catch the obscure case where the filename ends in ".tex\n", which
     would previously cause mysterious-looking problems.
   - Remove the 'hide extension' attribute on the .tex file, if TeXShop is
     used as the viewer, otherwise updating will fail for interesting reasons
     that I won't go into here.

2.6:
    - Suppress warnings when no viewer is explicitly selected; make sure the
      'hide extension' attribute is removed in that case too.
   - Integrate with Brad's new version of the LaTeX bundle: use the new prefs
     system.

2.7:
   - Fix TeXniscope support.
   - Deal more robustly with files that are written as well as read during
     processing (previously this could cause an infinite update loop)

2.8:
   - Locate '\begin{document}' in a more flexible way.
   - If an input file disappears, remove it from the watch list (otherwise it
     will recompiling the document in an endless loop).

2.9:
   - The loop-prevention code added in 2.7 did not work correctly in the case
     where a file is read from the preamble and written from the document body.
     This arises when the svn-multi package is used, for example. It should now
     work correctly.

3.0:
   - Use `latexmk` to translate documents. This change allows us to directly
   translate the whole document without the need to use any of the common
   external TeX tools (`bibtex`, `makeindex`, ‚Ä¶) directly.
   - Add support for `%!TEX TS-program`. We now try to read the typesetting
   program specified in the tex file. If the typesetting program is not
   specified inside the file then we use the engine specified in the settings
   dialog.

3.1:
    - Fix support for ‚ÄúTeXShop‚Äù PDF viewer.

3.2:
    - Update the list of auxiliary files removed on cleanup.

3.3:
    - (Re)add support for SyncTeX.

3.4:
    - Remove support for teTeX

3.5:
    - Remove support for TeXniscope

3.6:
    - Support engine options

      Add support for options like `--shell-escape`. You can specify these
      options inside the preferences of the LaTeX bundle. (Nemesit Amasis)

3.7:
    - Use the bundles `latexmkrc` file

3.8:
    - We now display a notification window in the case of an error. The window
    displays all errors containing line information that `texparser` finds in
    the log output of `latexmk`.

3.9:
    - Update the list of auxiliary files removed on cleanup.

3.10:
    - Remove temporary dir created by `pythontex` on cleanup.

3.11:
    - Remove temporary dir created by package `minted` on cleanup.

3.12:
    - Do not extend the environment variable TEXINPUTS any more. We used to do
      this to support ‚Äúpdfsync‚Äù. New TeX distributions include support for the
      ‚Äúpdfsync‚Äù replacement ‚ÄúSyncTeX‚Äù. This means we do not need to support
      ‚Äúpdfsync‚Äù any more.

3.13:
    - The script now reads the config file `auxiliary.yaml` to determine which
      files it removes on cleanup.

3.14:
    - Improve support for the minted package. Previously the script would
      sometimes refresh the viewer infinitely often, even if there were no
      changes to the watched document.

3.141:
    - Add new path for TeX binaries (MacTeX 2015, OS X 10.11). The script
      uses this value as backup, if we do not invoke it via ‚ÄúWatch Document‚Äù.

3.1415:
    - Use `clean.rb` to remove auxiliary files

3.14159:
    - The command now also removes the bundle cache file (`.filename.lb`)
      again, after we close the preview program.
