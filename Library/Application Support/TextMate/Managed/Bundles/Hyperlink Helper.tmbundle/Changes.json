This won&#39;t actually prevent a large download from being started but will prevent it from having much of an impact.\n\nAlso updates the script to ruby 2. Updating the script and adding the timeout necessitated changing the `TM_LINK_FORMAT` that use the title value. This is an unfortunate change as users may have created their own versions but in the worst case an empty title value is created. (The title variable will now always exist but with a nil value when there is no title found.)"},{"commit":"4dc23988a831051e0f035d7671ac458cafd5d408","date":"2018-07-10T01:19:29-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Lookup title for https links as well"},{"commit":"946fa49a7852a7d32513210b9cfd4ebd036de1c3","date":"2018-07-09T12:33:52-04:00","author":"Ronald Wampler","summary":"Change http â†’ https","body":"See http://lists.macromates.com/textmate/2018-July/040647.html"},{"commit":"0fcf5f93fc7311c2857671754e350a00dd05060c","date":"2017-02-03T17:53:50+07:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Use https for accessing Wikipedia"}],"name":"Hyperlink Helper"}
