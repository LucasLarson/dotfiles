## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community&nbsp;include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other&nbsp;people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and&nbsp;experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive&nbsp;feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the&nbsp;experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall&nbsp;community

Examples of unacceptable behavior&nbsp;include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
  of any&nbsp;kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or
  political&nbsp;attacks
- Public or private&nbsp;harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit&nbsp;permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional&nbsp;setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or&nbsp;harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when&nbsp;appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public&nbsp;spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline&nbsp;event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement
at&nbsp;[github@LucasLarson.net](mailto:github@LucasLarson.net). All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated promptly and&nbsp;fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any&nbsp;incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code
of&nbsp;Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the&nbsp;community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was&nbsp;inappropriate. A public apology may be&nbsp;requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of&nbsp;actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued&nbsp;behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of&nbsp;time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social&nbsp;media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent&nbsp;ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate&nbsp;behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of&nbsp;time. No public
or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code
of&nbsp;Conduct. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent&nbsp;ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes
of&nbsp;individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the&nbsp;community.
